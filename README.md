# Social Media Analysis on Reddit Posts

## The Problem

We frame a hypothetical business problem where a social media brand wants to improve user engagement. More specificallly, the number of posts read per session. Findings from user surveys has revealed that searchability of posts plays an influential role in this metric. This means that users that are able to find content readily, are likely to visit and read more posts per session. 

A big part of making searchable content is good organization of content. Currently, users designate a subreddit for a post by themselves prior to posting it. However, the social media brand wants to go a step further, and pin an additional tag on posts automatically, based on the content of the post and other features. The analysis looks into 4 such tags i.e. 'todayilearned', 'Games', 'nba' and 'atheism'.

The objective of this analysis is to explore the capacity of predictive models to achieve this. We'll train our models from historic posts made within these tags. A secondary objective is to explore the sentiment of these subreddits. 

## Process
