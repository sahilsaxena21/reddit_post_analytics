# Social Media Analytics on Reddit Posts

## Define Problem

We frame a hypothetical business problem where a social media brand wants to improve user engagement. More specificallly, the number of posts read per session. Findings from user surveys has revealed that searchability of posts plays an influential role in this metric. This means that users that are able to find content readily, are likely to visit and read more posts per session.

However, the social media brand wants to go a step further, and pin an additional tag on posts across subreddits automatically, based on the content of the post and other features. 

The objective of this analysis is to explore the capacity of predictive models to achieve this. The scope of the analysis is to be able to tag posts which falls under 'todayilearned', 'Games', 'nba' and 'atheism'.  be able to learn the feature distribution of each tag from a labelled dataset, and then be able to re

be able to suggest suitable tags. We take a labelled dataset of historic tags on posts. A secondary objective is to explore the sentiment of certain subreddits. The subreddits in scope are
